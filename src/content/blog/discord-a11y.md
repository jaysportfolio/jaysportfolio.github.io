Many apps and sites get so focused on getting something out the door, they leave certain people behind. Discord was no exception. We had an amazing product that millions and millions of people loved, but how could we tout a mission of "belonging" when there were certain people who couldn't use our app?

Since joining in 2018, I've helped my designers ship a bunch of accessibility features: Reduced Motion, Role Dots, text-to-speech speed settings, and more. My contributions focused more on UX writing and microcopy clarity. Being accessible is more than keyboard navigation: it's color, word hierarchy, and even word choices. An accessible app is also a concise one; the more jargon you use to explain your product to people, the more chances you could be alienating someone.

## What we needed
To align with WCAG across our entire app. Everything also had to work on both light and dark theme (having different themes = accessibility!)

With both UX research and user feedback, we identified issues with Discord's accessibility, ranging from colors that needed to be changed to entirely new settings to be added.

## What I did
My contributions centered around how we explained settings and changes to users, how we arranged information on a page, and what words we used to describe things, which included help establishing internal style guidelines on inclusive language, while my designers have done amazing work getting Discord visually compliant.

I focused on recommendations for making information easier to scan. On the average web-page visit, users read only 28% of the words, and that number decreases with younger users. Discord's audience skews young, so I wanted to advocate for content they could comfortably interact with. Capitalization choice, content length, and CTA location all play a part in a11y compliance.

## What happened
Discord has made some amazing improvements, and we're on track to be fully WCAG Level 2.1 AA compliant by 2023!

There's a list of updates the team has been burning through, and we hope to enable everyone to use Discord.

## What I would do differently
Accessibility is never finished, and Discord still has a lot of work to when it comes to clarity. I'd love to focus next on getting our settings menus to a much better place. Below is some of the work I've started on mapping a user journey through our settings so we can start improving and clarifying.

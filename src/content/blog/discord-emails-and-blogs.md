  Here's a few snippets of some long-form, brand-voice content.

I was the only writer at Discord for a while and touched a lot of surfaces! Here's a few snippets of my longer work, including the popular Discord patch notes, where I somehow got people to care about when a chat app updated. A glorified newsletter with almost a 100 million readers and a 30% read through rate? Not bad.

I was also the copy lead on the 2019/2020 brand refresh and updated all surfaces across the web and app,
<LinkButton
        className="underline decoration-dashed underline-offset-4 hover:text-skin-accent"
        href="https://www.discord.com/company"
      >
        which included this small but wholesome about section.
      </LinkButton>

The Discord patch notes were one of the most popular parts of the app. They recieved a lot of user love, and were /the/ surface where I could show off with the brand voice the most.

And here's a poor quality screenshot of one of my many, many emails I had to write and edit...

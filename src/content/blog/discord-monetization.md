**Discord Nitro** allows you to personalize your Discord experience with custom emoji, stickers, profiles, as well as more powerful features like bigger uploads and screen share limits.

As a freemium product, monetization success was very important to the overall health of Discord.

Over the years these products have changed a lot. I closely collaborated on these features with some amazing designers on all these projects: Karen, San, Jenn, Bobby. I also worked with product managers, marketing managers, social, and engineering, and worked on other supported clients like mobile.

The team and myself identified three key areas that needed help:

1. Make Nitro more understandable to the average person **(Marketing)**
2. Improve our conversion funnels **(Upsells)**
3. Have more people stick once they sign up **(Churn)**

## Marketing
First, I worked with the team to understand the story we were trying to tell: What were the most important benefits and how could I make a journey out of them?

Turns out, our users love expressing themselves. They want to use their own emoji, make their profiles pretty, and be whoever they want. But the Nitro marketing page was very outdated, cluttered, and uninspiring.

Following our studies, I then worked with the team on honing in on a slogan, which help informed the rest of the page hierarchy. We focused on what users were telling us was most important, redesigning the page to put this information up front.

I helped improve information architecture across the page, cutting down on words where I could and mapping out how the eye was guided through this page. figuring out: What information was grabbing you first, what information was competing, what information is repeating, does a user immediately understand how to sign up?

The team also concluded that the messaging in our marketing was very direct; we were blocking ourselves by only explaining what features were was and how users could activate it. We worked on messaging that told a more cohesive story about Nitro, with the goal: If I line up 3 of our selling pointsside-by-side, I should be able to see how Nitro features work together to bring me a better Discord experience.    

Mapping this out, I worked with my designer to create a version of this page that solved these issues.

## Upsells

Then, I looked at the funnels leading you to this page and signing up. I quickly realized we had a lot of design debt:

1. Upsells had different messaging styles and buttons.
2. Some upsells had different conversion funnels. Specifically, some lead users to our marketing page while others take them directly to the payment plans.
3. Some flows took users to a single payment plan (Nitro), while others take them to a multi payment plan (Nitro Classic + Nitro).  

With so many inconsistencies, it was difficult to measure the maximum potential of our Nitro features to increase subs. To get the most accurate data for learnings, we needed to formalize our Nitro upsells and how they lead users through the Nitro experience. For this, I looked at:

- Upsells, which were inconsistent in their value props.
- Buttons, which were inconsistent in their CTAs.
- We would flip flop between negative and positives, telling users what they can't do
- Killing hyperlinks, which were causing many users to bounce
- What journey we were taking the user on

I then mapped out how we were currently guiding users through the purchase flow and found that we used 4 separate calls to actions, interchangeably using words like: Subscribe, Get Nitro, Upgrade to Nitro, varying ways of language formatting, and mismatched user journeys.

This was making the impact of these upsells and buttons hard to measure. We defaulted to using Get Nitro, removing hyperlinks, focusing on the positives (what users could do) and ran a 7 day A/B test before making the change, looking for a neutral/positive result.

## Churn

Later, we focused on how we could get subscribers to stick better. People genuinely did not know what they were losing when they canceled because we never made it clear, so we added extra steps to the cancelation process. It was imperative to me that this wasn't scummy, and didn't add unnecessary steps like trying to get out of a gym membership. I did not want users to jump through hoops, but we needed our cancellation process to inform users of what exactly they were losing.

We came to a solution of showcasing a personalized list of all the features they either currently used and were going to lose, or a list of features they had access to but never touched.

This turned out to be a huge success with over a 10% decrease in churning subs, and confirmed our theories that people want to pay for Nitro, but we were making benefits unclear.

## What happened
Nitro subscriptions went up, and churn rates especially went down. Following the success of these projects we added extra revenue avenues like Boosting and Premium Membership, which focus less on the individual using Discord and more on improving the community experience.

## What I would do differently
Focus a lot more on the broader story of Nitro much earlier, and cut down on the jargon. Work with the team on raising Nitro awareness before we focus on fixing Nitro marketing, and learn to understand international needs.

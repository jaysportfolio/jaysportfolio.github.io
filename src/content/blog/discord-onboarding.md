In 2020, we repositioned Discord to be friendly and useable by anyone, not just gamers. Not only did the copy in the app need to be updated, but the experience of using Discord needed an improvement. 

So, we started at the beginning: registration flow, onboarding, and helping users create places to hang out.

I worked mostly with PMMs, engineers, and a handful of product designers: San, Selina, Brett, and Daniel, who all rule and made this possible.

What we needed
With both quantitative data and user feedback, we identified issues with Discord’s registration and onboarding:

- We didn’t educate users about what makes Discord unique (servers, channels, etc.), which lead to a lot of churn and sentiments that Discord was "confusing."

- After registration, we didn't really tell you what to do next.

- Finding your friends on the app was difficult.

What we did
In tandem with my amazing designers and researchers, I was able to help recreate and refine the entire experience.

My contributions centered around how users flowed through setting up their account, how we educated them about Discord, and how we got them to set up a server.

It also included establishing and focusing on new value props, like talking and hanging out, to help the average person understand what exactly we could do for them.

We removed Discord's old "quest" system that brought you throughout the app, and I worked with designers to implement a new educational framework.

Find Your Friends was a particularly tricky problem we had to navigate. We wanted people to enable this feature, but we did not want to invade their privacy; I helped strike a balance between informative and trustworthy, which resulted in very little negative user sentiment.

## What happened
All of these changes are live today on mobile and desktop. We've since been collecting countless feedback from users, especially concerning clarity and confusion, and hope to continue making Discord easy to join and stick with.

## What I would do differently
Small things here and there, like tighten up some of the copy. I'd mostly get these pages up to speed with our current content design systems (buttons should be sentence case, not title, and making sure we're using the right version of Login vs Log in...).

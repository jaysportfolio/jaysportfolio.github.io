  I've made Tweets that have gotten 100s of millions of impressions (scary).

I managed Discord's social channels, including Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube and sent out Tweets that got a lot of love. My work has been seen by a few million people with hundreds of millions of impressions across Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook: I helped Discord reach their first million followers and a single Tweet of mine receieved over 20 million impressions. Which is scary to think about. Here's a few of examples:
